Each model is available in both standard and SCT (Smart Cut Technology) variants.

## System Components

The SmartSaw MTConnect system consists of the following components:

- MTConnect Agent: Handles communication and data collection
- HEMsaw adapter: Interfaces with the saw control system
- ODS (Object Database System): Manages data storage and retrieval
- DEVCTL (Device Control Platform): Enables remote programming of materials and jobs
- MQTT Broker: Manages message queuing and communication
- MongoDB database: Stores parts, jobs, and material data
- Docker containerization: Ensures consistent deployment

## Key Features

- Servo-controlled saw head (X-axis)
- Feed servo control (Z-axis)
- Band motor monitoring and control
- Door state monitoring (drive and idle doors)
- Cut time and CPU on time tracking
- Material handling capabilities
- Smart Cut Technology (SCT) variants available

## Getting started

To get the agent working on the IPC for the first time the github repoistory needs to be cloned.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --progress --depth 1 https://github.com/HEM-Inc/MTConnect_SmartSaw.git mtconnect
```

After cloning the repository for the first time run the install script. This will locate the files into the correct locations.

```bash
sudo bash ssInstall.sh
```

IF the agent has already be loaded then use the update script to update the files and restart the service.

```bash
sudo bash ssUpgrade.sh
```

Edit the `env.sh` file for setting the default install file names on this unique install. These will persist across all updates and installs on that machine. Note use of the parameters will overwrite the file names in the `env.sh` file.

Help syntax for the `ssInstall.sh`.
